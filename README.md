# refactorAI
This project is an AI-powered code analysis assistant that not only detects errors in source code but also explains them clearly and provides a corrected, professional solution. Unlike basic debuggers that stop at error messages, this system analyzes the intent of the question or problem (such as DAA, DSA, or logic-based problems)
