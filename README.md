# RefactorAI

RefactorAI is an AI-powered code analysis assistant that not only detects
syntax and logical errors in source code but also explains them clearly
and provides a corrected, professional solution.

Unlike traditional compilers or debuggers that stop at error messages,
RefactorAI analyzes the intent of the question (e.g., DSA, algorithms,
logic-based problems) and presents a clean, well-structured solution
with meaningful naming conventions and inline comments.

## Key Features
- Detects syntax, runtime, and logical errors
- Explains mistakes in simple language
- Provides corrected and optimized code
- Understands problem intent (DSA, logic, algorithms)
- Produces professional, compiler-style feedback

## Use Cases
- Students learning programming
- Debugging practice
- Competitive programming preparation
- Code review and refactoring
- Teaching assistants and instructors

## Uniqueness
RefactorAI does not stop at error detection.
It behaves like a **smart evaluator** that:
- Understands *what the question is asking*
- Names variables and functions meaningfully
- Adds comments as if written by a professional developer
- Produces clean, readable, industry-style code
